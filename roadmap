Description:
A collection of python scripts for quick image processing.

Planned Features:

Must Have:
Can be called from the root to affect files anywhere in the system.

Should Have:
Integration Tests

A --help optional argument that can support different outputs for every module.
    The planned workflow is as follows:
    >> process_img.py --help
        # Describes how to use the program and lists all modules with
        a brief description for each module

    >> process_img.py --help [module]
    >> process_img.py [module] --help
        # Outputs what the modules does and the available arguments
        and optional arguments with a brief description of each
    I want to have a json file that can be easily queried and outputed to the
    user.


Could Have:
Add a Threshold of hue values for the colorswap module.
Filter input images by name (with regex?).
Filter input images by file type.
Works on Linux and Windows.

On the same line of tougth of the --help functionality described above,
we can have commands to display the program's LICENSE, change a default
setting (such as the default color used on removal of backgrouds).
